If |F|δ<|A|<|F|1−δ for some δ>0, then we prove the estimate $|A+A| + |A.A| geq c(delta) |A|^{1+eps}$ for some $eps = eps(delta) > 0$. This is a finite field analogue of a result of Erdos and Szemeredi. We then use this estimate to prove a Szemeredi-Trotter type theorem in finite fields, and obtain a new estimate for the Erdos distance problem in finite fields, as well as the three-dimensional Kakeya problem in finite fields."

Consider a discrete-time signal $f in C^N$ and a randomly chosen set of frequencies Omega of mean size tauN.
